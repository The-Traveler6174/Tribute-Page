        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p id="info-text">When it comes to marijuana activists and advocates, beatnik badass John Sinclair was as OG as they come. 

Growing up in a middle-class Republican household in the small town of Davison, Michigan, Sinclair was first turned on to jazz, poetry, and marijuana in 1959 while attending Albion College. He then moved on to graduate school at Wayne State University in Detroit, where he quickly ingratiated himself into Motor City’s bohemian leftist community. 

In October 1964, Sinclair was arrested for selling $10 of weed to an undercover cop and sentenced to two years’ probation. Weeks later, he dropped out of college and co-founded both the Detroit Artists Workshop and the Artists’ Workshop Press. Then, in January 1965, he founded Detroit LEMAR (LEgalize MARijuana), a chapter of the nation’s first Cannabis advocacy group originally formed by the Yippies in New York. As the head of Detroit LEMAR, Sinclair organized meetings and printed pamphlets in support of marijuana, establishing himself as one of the true founding fathers of the legalization movement. 

In August 1965, Sinclair was busted again for weed and sentenced to another two years’ probation and six months in the Detroit House of Correction. Rather than be deterred by his incarceration, however, Sinclair only became more determined in his activist efforts.  </p>
        <h2>Activisim</h2>
        <p id="info-text">Sinclair was music editor and columnist for the Detroit underground newspaper, Fifth Estate, during the paper's growth in the late 1960s. Fifth Estate continues to publish to this day, making it one of the longest continuously published alternative periodicals in the United States. In an era before the internet, he was an influential publisher, columnist and editor of counter cultural newspapers and other documents, some of which still survive.

Sinclair also contributed to the formation of Detroit Artists Workshop Press, which published five issues of Work Magazine. Sinclair worked as a jazz writer for DownBeat from 1964 to 1965, being an outspoken advocate for the newly emerging Free Jazz Avant Garde movement. Sinclair was one of the "New Poets" who read at the seminal Berkeley Poetry Conference in July 1965.

In April 1967, he founded the Ann Arbor Sun, a biweekly underground newspaper, with his wife Leni Sinclair and artist Gary Grimshaw.</p>
<p id="info-text">He was front and center on the issue of legalization of cannabis, and promoted its benefits while decrying its illegality. He was there to prominently buy legal cannabis when it became legal in Michigan. Magdalen "Leni" Sinclair is credited as an unsung hero of the fight for legalization—she took over for John during his two years in prison.

The argument for legalization was summed up in a 2011 Sinclair interview, which highlighted the original goal of Hash Bash was total legalization. He said:

"They need to get rid of this idiotic, hypocritical war on drugs. Marijuana, there's nothing wrong with it," he said. "It doesn't harm anybody, it's not a dangerous substance, and millions of people use it—and they're just characterized as criminals by these people whose drug of choice is alcohol. So the first thing you get rid of is tremendous hypocrisy"</p>

<p id="info-text">Sinclair and Pun Plamondon established a commune at 1510 Hill Street. They founded the White Panther Party, which supported the goals of the Black Panther Party. He was indicted for bombing a CIA office in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on September 29, 1968.

Sinclair was somewhat dismissive of the fact that he was imprisoned — something like, 'it comes with the job.'

During the 1960s, the White Panther Party, the precursor to the Rainbow People's Party, billed itself as an "anti racist political collective." They hosted free live concerts in Ann Arbor's West Park, until city council ended them. While Sinclair ventured the opinion that LSD was the catalyst that would bring the downfall of Western civilization. Some donned long guns and ammunition belts for photo opportunities and target practice. Some claim that was as aggressive as they became. "One member of the Black Panthers reportedly dismissed the dope-smoking Panthers from Michigan as 'psychedelic clowns.'" However, the dramatic poseurs got the attention of civil authorities. who called "the Panthers "potentially the largest and most dangerous of revolutionary organizations in the United States."</p>

        <h2>Ten for Two</h2>
        <p id="info-text">In the years following his third arrest, Sinclair’s lawyers engaged in a protracted legal battle with the Michigan courts to challenge the constitutionality of the state’s draconian drug laws, arguing that marijuana was not a narcotic and that the mandated sentence of 20 years to life represented “cruel and unusual punishment.” After numerous defeated motions, the case finally went to trial on July 22, 1969. Three days later, the jury found him guilty of possession, and on Monday, July 28, he was sentenced to a staggering nine and a half to 10 years in state prison. 
Sinclair’s outrageous sentence made national headlines and galvanized the entire counterculture community under the rallying cry “Ten for Two” (ten years for two joints). Leni and John’s brother David orchestrated a massive campaign to free him by organizing benefits, selling “Free John Now!” merch, sending letters to Congress with joints in them, and recruiting celebrated activists on John’s behalf. Famously, Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman even stormed on stage at Woodstock during The Who’s set and gave an impromptu speech about Sinclair’s plight (while allegedly tripping on White Lightning) before Pete Townsend reportedly hit him with his guitar and sent him packing.</p>
        <p id="info-text">In the summer of 1971, The Committee to Free John Sinclair organized their largest benefit yet — securing the University of Michigan’s new Crisler Arena for December 10, and booking a lineup of prominent activist speakers and performers, including Bob Seger, Stevie Wonder, and even former Beatle John Lennon, who after talking with Yippie pals Ed Sanders and Jerry Rubin, agreed to headline the event for free. John and Yoko’s participation was announced at a press conference two days before the event, and tickets sold out within three hours. 

“It was like God was coming to Ann Arbor,” WPP member David Fenton remembered. 

The eight hours of activism, entertainment, and marijuana smoke climaxed with Lennon’s performance (his first since the Beatles’ breakup) at three a.m. He and Yoko played a four-song acoustic set, closing out with an eponymous new anthem he’d written for Sinclair:

“It ain’t fair, John Sinclair / In the stir for breathin’ air … They gave him ten for two / And what else can the judges do? / They gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta … set him free.”

Three days later, on December 13, that’s exactly what they did.</p>
        <p id="info-text">During his incarceration, Sinclair’s communal collective evolved once again: turns out, the name “White Panther Party” sounded to some like a white supremacist group — the very opposite of their purpose. So in 1971, the WPP essentially disbanded and reconstituted as the community-oriented Rainbow Peoples Party and the politically-oriented Human Rights Party. The following year, HRP got two candidates elected to the City Council, enabling them to pass an ordinance making marijuana possession a civil offense carrying a fine of just $5 and making Ann Arbor the first city in America to decriminalize Cannabis. </p>

        <p id="info-text">After successfully reforming Michigan’s marijuana laws, Sinclair retired from activism and shifted focus back to creative pursuits. First, he moved back to Detroit, where he became an arts editor for the Detroit Sun and hosted a radio show at WDET. Later, in 1991, he moved to New Orleans, where he spent 12 years DJing at WWOZ, writing about music, and forming his own spoken word/jazz band, John Sinclair and His Blues Scholars. Then, from 2003 to 2008, he lived in Amsterdam, where he launched Radio Free Amsterdam (broadcasting live from the 420 Café each week), and created The John Sinclair Foundation — a non-profit dedicated to preserving his artistic legacy. 

And what a legacy it was: over his lifetime, Sinclair released over 20 albums and wrote countless books, essays, and articles — including the long-running column “Free the Weed” and the seminal pro-pot manifesto “Marijuana Revolution” (in 1971). 

After moving back to Detroit in 2008, he opened the John Sinclair Foundation Café in 2018 and became one of the first people in Michigan to purchase weed legally in December 2019 after the passage of Measure 1. Despite his declining health, he remained a revered figurehead, appearing and speaking at Hash Bash each year. 

John Sinclair died of congestive heart failure at the Detroit Receiving Hospital on the morning of Tuesday, April 2, 2024. He was 82.</p>
